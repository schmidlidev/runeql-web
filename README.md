[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/710bc572-8c17-4b7e-9299-6bf58a1ca5ee/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/runeql/deploys)

Static website for RuneQL

## Development

```sh
yarn install
```

Serve locally from `src/`

Note that the graphdoc pages at `schema/` are not immediately present in development. In production they are generated by `yarn build`, but if you'd like them locally you can generate them with:

```sh
npx @2fd/graphdoc --force -e https://api.runeql.com/ -o ./src/schema
```

## Production

```sh
yarn build
```

Serve from `dist/`

## Netlify Builds

Netlify automatically rebuilds the live site on push to `main`.

The CI/CD pipeline for the primary [RuneQL](https://github.com/schmidlidev/runeql) repository also automatically triggers a Netlify rebuild following a succesful deployment, so that the graphdoc documentation is always be up to date.

## Built with

* [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [graphdoc](https://github.com/2fd/graphdoc)
